Templates - Repository
======================

This repository consists of templates for different technologies with different combinations. These templates help you to start a sample application with the specified technology. In some cases you may not find libraries for licensed versions. For example Extjs is a licensed  version, then sample project may not be having extjs library, so please make sure that you have those libraries with you. Include them in this sample template before running the application. Many of the applications are created using maaven as of now. Once you download these templates, each template consists of a batch file in it, you can run this batch file(for windows versions) to convert them into eclipse projects.
